Background introduction <br />
What are the problems for the equipment provider, the equipment manufacturer, or the equipment renter with the fine management of the equipment?
1) The geographical location of equipment installation is scattered. Due to various reasons, the geographical location of equipment installation is completely distributed all over the country or even all over the world.The state and utilization rate of the equipment are unknown, and most of the equipment is in the state of unattended management.
2) The manufacturer, production age, model and interface of the equipment are not exactly the same.Trying to push data collection from all devices onto one platform is a headache.
3) Incomplete data, disordered sources and inaccurate data lead to complete chaos in equipment management and uneconomical and scientific maintenance.
4) Delayed equipment data, analysis of business equipment historical data, and failure processing are basically failure reprocessing.
5) No one knows or is not complete the key data such as energy consumption data, usage situation, etc., multi-position statistics, data fighting, how can the data be trusted?
Demand analysis
Owner's Demand:
The data of scattered devices will be collected into a unified platform to provide a good data foundation for the application.
Low cost to realize remote inspection and remote diagnosis of all devices.
It is very convenient to realize the management of equipment on a unified platform.
Potential problems and risks of equipment can be predicted and dealt with in advance through real-time operation data and historical data of equipment.
Use device data to develop business applications and so on.
Requirements of equipment manufacturer or operation and maintenance provider:
Check the running status and historical data of the device anytime and anywhere.
Keep abreast of equipment maintenance, equipment failure and other information.
Anticipate problems or failures that may occur in the future.
Master the running state of the equipment and provide the best service to the end users.
Through the statistical analysis of equipment data, continuously improve product quality and develop more valuable product functions.
Plan to introduce
The design of the equipment operation and maintenance platform adopts the concept of "taking the initiative in everything". The core of this concept is to realize the active reporting of the running state of the equipment, and then realize the remote maintenance, early warning and fault prediction of the equipment, etc.The purpose is to maximize the life cycle of equipment and reduce the cost of equipment operation and maintenance to the greatest extent.
The data of equipment operation will be analyzed and compared to predict the equipment that may fail in advance, and the planned active shutdown and maintenance will be carried out to minimize the failure loss.
The equipment operation and maintenance plan of Dongbamboo science and Technology can help customers collect the full amount of data of all equipment into a unified platform, and provide perfect, accurate and reliable data foundation for the application and development of the system.On this basis, real-time equipment positioning, working condition monitoring, energy consumption analysis, equipment anomaly analysis, fault warning, work operation statistics, etc., can truly realize the "self-diagnosis, self-adaptation, self-adjustment" of equipment.
The equipment operation and maintenance platform can help enterprises upgrade from traditional manufacturers to equipment r&d, production and operation service providers.
Monitor the running status of remote devices and the use of consumables in real time through the equipment operation and maintenance platform, alert users in advance and inform them of purchase channels and service contents, etc.
1) Device end
On the device side, select the suitable model of ThingsLink according to the interface type of the target device and networking conditions. ThingsLink provides Ethernet /RS232/RS485/CAN interfaces on the communication mode with the device.In terms of networking mode, static IP/DHCP/PPPOE/GPRS/LTE and other networking modes are provided.Users connect ThingsLink to the target device's communication interface, plug in and power up the ThingsLink, set up the connection mode (generally no setting is required), and then manage the ThingsLink configuration on the gateway operation platform ThingsCloud.

2) platform
Users manage all gateway devices under their names through ThingsCloud, a unified gateway operation and maintenance platform, and realize all full-function operations of the gateway through the platform. They install and configure applications for the gateway on the platform, develop applications for the gateway on the platform, debug applications on the platform, and query the operation records and events of the gateway through the platform.

Functional description
The gateway can be installed with wiring network, no professional skill is required.
Gateway device application once development, infinite reuse, no configuration.
Batch installation and deployment, minimum labor cost to achieve system expansion and migration.
Through remote operation and maintenance platform to achieve the gateway management and maintenance, fault analysis and so on
Record the operation record of data acquisition equipment through remote operation and maintenance platform.
Through the remote operation and maintenance platform to achieve the remote management of equipment, equipment programming
Device map management: manage each node and each device visually through the map.
Cloud computing strategy management, distribution edge gateway for computing.
conclusion
Greatly save the equipment data collection, equipment maintenance labor cost and time cost.
Completely change the traditional equipment operation and maintenance platform operation and maintenance mode, improve the production efficiency.
Through the platform, the operation mode of equipment and even process parameters can be adjusted more flexibly.
Realize the cooperation and interaction between manufacturers, devices, users, experts and other roles, and realize the integration of people and devices.
